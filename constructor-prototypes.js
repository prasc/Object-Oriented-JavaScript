//Example 1
let obj = {};


// this object is created using the Object constructor function
// This constructor has a prototype property and this is the object that will be used for the prototype for all objects created by this constructor
obj.__proto__
// both are equal
Object.prototype;

// Example 2
let array = [];
array.__proto__
Array.prototype
